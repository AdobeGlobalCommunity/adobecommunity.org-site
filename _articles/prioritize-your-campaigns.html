<h2>The Issue: Managing Multiple Campaigns Concurrently</h2>
<p>For&nbsp;any organization that runs a multitude of marketing campaigns on a regular basis, one complaint often heard is that the more campaigns an organization has running, the more challenging it is to ensure the customer is receiving the right one. Without managing this larger quantity of campaigns properly, a business will run the risk of overlap &ndash; overcommunicating to recipients, sending them the wrong message at the wrong time and potentially losing your ability to deliver messages to them moving forward (channel or global opt-out).</p>
<p>The first instinct of most companies is to <a href="https://www.celerity-is.com/us/our-thoughts/using-typology-rules-adobe-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create rules within workflows</a> limiting a household from receiving one campaign if they have already been selected for another; however, as the business evolves and more campaigns are implemented, these rules become extremely difficult to keep track of and organize. This puts the marketing department in a difficult position, forcing both time and resources to be allocated to a manual process, extensive documentation and a high risk of institutional knowledge loss when an employee leaves the company.&nbsp; Additionally, in many companies the team responsible for executing the campaigns is not the same as the team creating the business rules. This can cause communication gaps and slow the business&rsquo; ability to read and react.</p>
