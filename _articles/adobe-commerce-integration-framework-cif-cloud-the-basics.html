<p>Commerce needs to be experience driven and make every moment shoppable. This is one of five <a href="https://blogs.perficient.com/adobe/2018/01/24/5-digital-trends-for-2018-can-drive-the-future-of-aem-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital trends for 2018</a> that can drive the future of AEM and more. We are seeing some solid progress. As part of the big initiative Adobe announced to <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-reimagines-commerce-platform-enable-experience-driven-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enable experience driven commerce</a>, a brand new <a href="https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/commerce-integration-framework.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Cloud Commerce Integration Framework</a> (CCIF) is underway and actively developed by Adobe. Recently, I got a chance to work with the teams at Perficient and Adobe to preview, test, provide feedbacks on the new CCIF and started integration with IBM commerce and Magento. In this series of blogs, I am going to share the basics of Adobe Commerce Integration Framework (CIF) Cloud, how it works, what you need to implement, the resources to help you get started, and an integration POC developed by Perficient using this new framework.</p>
<p>The Adobe Commerce Integration Framework (CIF) Cloud is currently on close beta. It&rsquo;s expecting to be on beta this June. It&rsquo;s supposed to roll out a connector with AEM sites and integration with Commercetools first. Then more connectors (i.e. assets, Livefyre, Target, Campaign) and integrations (i.e. Hybris, Magento, IBM) will be added later this year. The new framework is currently targeted for AMS customers, on premises support will be added later. And it&rsquo;s supported for AEM 6.3 and above.</p>
