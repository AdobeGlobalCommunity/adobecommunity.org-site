<p>In today&rsquo;s business world, there is no shortage of&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.capterra.com/surprising-project-management-statistics/">studies and statistics</a>&nbsp;that demonstrate that software implementation and IT projects are more likely to fail than not and as a result your resources, time and money are at stake. Despite the odds not being in favor of these types of projects, concrete ways to ensure your implementation is successful do exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; It starts with active, realistic project sponsorship at the executive level and a rock-solid Project Management approach to lead the effort.
