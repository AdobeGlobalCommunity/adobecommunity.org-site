<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://cqdump.wordpress.com/2018/04/23/content-and-configuration/">previous blog posting</a>&nbsp;I outlined why there&rsquo;s a need to store some configuration outside of OSGI and I named&nbsp;<a href="https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/context-aware-configuration/context-aware-configuration.html">Sling Context-Aware Configuration</a>&nbsp;(CA-Config) as a way to implement it.</p>
<p>CA-Config is a relative new feature of AEM (introduced with AEM 6.2) which stores the configuration inside the repository; but besides that it offers some features, which are handy in a lot of usecases:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don&rsquo;t deal with nodes and resources anymore, but only with POJOs. This kind of implementation completly hides where the configuration is stored, but the location of the config is stored as property on the node.</li>
<li>CA-Config implements an approach based on the repository hierarchy. If a configuration value is not found at the specified config location, the hierarchy is walked towards the root and further configurations are consulted, until a configuration is found or the root node is hit (in that case a default value for the configuration should be used).</li>
<li>the lookup process is very configurable, although the default one is sufficient in most cases.</li>
</ul>
