<p>I just have to write a post about this small tip that I noticed on Adobe&rsquo;s forum:&nbsp;<a href="https://forums.adobe.com/ideas/10106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://forums.adobe.com/ideas/10106</a>&nbsp;Thanks to Jen!<br />(Btw, if you haven&rsquo;t voted that idea&hellip; what are you waiting for!? Hit the &ldquo;vote up&rdquo; button!)</p>
<p>In Workspace, you can add &ldquo;text&rdquo; panel to your project and write detailed descriptions for different tables and visualizations. Have used a lot this &ldquo;text&rdquo; panel. However, this way text is always on a different &ldquo;module&rdquo; and sometimes it might be difficult to align these text panels to the data panels etc. Thanks to Jen, I realized that you can edit freeform table&rsquo;s description and this way you get same kind of text panel injected directly to the same freeform table. How did I have missed this feature?</p>
