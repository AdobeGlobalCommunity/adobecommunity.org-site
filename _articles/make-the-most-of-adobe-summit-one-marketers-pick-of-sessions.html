<p>I&rsquo;m going to bet that you&rsquo;ve recently had a conversation with friends and family that goes something like this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, I was just having this conversation about&nbsp;<em>(insert topic here)</em>&nbsp;and literally the next day, ads for that product/service started to show up in Facebook/Twitter/YouTube/email.&nbsp; That is so creepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Creepy?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; If the ads or the topic wasn&rsquo;t relevant to you, yes, it would be creepy.&nbsp; They would be not targeted and not thus, not valuable.&nbsp; Creepy.&nbsp; However, if the ads were actually valuable to your&nbsp;goal of, say, going on vacation, exploring a new product your friend talked about, or a discount for a brand that you admire, it wouldn&rsquo;t be creepy.&nbsp; (OK, admittedly, it still would be creepy, but you wouldn&rsquo;t immediately complain.)</p>
