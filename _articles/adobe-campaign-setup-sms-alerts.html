<p>Adobe Campaign comes with real-time Error Managment and Alert generation mechanism for Campaign &amp; Technical workflows. The alerts so generated are sent to assigned group operators that have valid email address in order to receive the notification.</p>
<p>Out-of-box <em>email</em> based template used to send Monitoring alerts is located at:</p>
<p><em>Administration &gt; Campaign Management &gt; Technical delivery templates &gt; <strong>Send an alert to workflow task assignees (alertAssignee)</strong></em></p>

<p>This blog take this process a step forward if we want to recieve these <strong>alerts as SMS</strong> rather than email <em>for quicker turnaround</em>. <strong>This could prove to useful particularly relating to technical workflows like import/export workflows where we normally have dependencies with&nbsp; upstream &amp; downstream applications.</strong></p>
