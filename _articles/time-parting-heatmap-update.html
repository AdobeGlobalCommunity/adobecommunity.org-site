<p>A few days ago I wrote <a href="http://perfectdashboard.rocks/time-parting-heatmap/">a blog post about creating a heatmap independant of segments and timeframes</a>. At least I thought it is perfect &hellip; While adding the table to some dashboards I mentioned some problems with the setup. That&rsquo;s the reason why I write an Update on the same topic.</p>
<p>Warning The following solution for the heatmap is for advanced Adobe Analytics users who are used to create calculated metrics. And to fully understand why I&rsquo;m doing some of the calculations, I recommend reading the first blog before you continue.</p>
