<p><a href="https://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/target/search-and-promote.html" target="_blank">Adobe Search&amp;Promote</a>&nbsp;is a powerful SaaS search offering within the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud.html" target="_blank">Adobe Marketing Cloud</a>.&nbsp;Adobe offers an integration between Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Search&amp;Promote using&nbsp;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/sites/administering/using/search-and-promote.html" target="_blank">AEM&rsquo;s Cloud Services</a>. This integration is meant to allow authors to easily deploy and configure basic search experiences with the two tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is an issue with the integration where AEM will cache the Stage URL for Adobe Search&amp;Promote&rsquo;s API endpoint. While you can force Adobe Search&amp;Promote to use the Live index with the sp_staged parameter, it will still use the Stage configuration. This is a serious problem as it means that you may be using configurations which are not tested or not ready yet to be live.&nbsp;</p>
