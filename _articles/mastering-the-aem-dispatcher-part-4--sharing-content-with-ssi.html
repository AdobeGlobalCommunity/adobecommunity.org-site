We're delving deeper into the AEM Dispatcher as we continue in the series, Mastering the AEM Dispatcher. In this post, we'll discuss how to share content with non-AEM applications in the Dispatcher using SSI includes. Integrating AEM and non-AEM websites is tricky. To create a consistent look and feel, you need to share the stylesheets, header, and footer, but you don't want to be duplicating information or hard-coding in markup into non-AEM sites. If your website lives in or publishes to Apache, you can use Server Side Includes (or SSI) to include the content seamlessly into the non-AEM websites. Using SSI to include content from AEM websites on non-AEM sites, requires a few steps to get set up and work properly to avoid caching issues.
