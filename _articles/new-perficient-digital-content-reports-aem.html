<p>Last week a new version of ACS AEM Commons, 3.14.0 dropped. This latest release included a new feature&nbsp;for creating configurable reports. These reports allow semi-technical users and administrators to create and execute custom reports and export the results as a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why do you need Content Reports?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Content reports allow authors and content managers to get easy access to critical information such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Which pages are published vs. unpublished</li>
<li>What pages have a particular component</li>
<li>The status of authoring efforts or workflows</li>
<li>List of pages updated by a report process</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in AEM OOTB, this cannot be done without developer support.&nbsp;Now, with the ACS AEM Commons Report Builder, all of these reports can be created by any semi-technical author.</p>
