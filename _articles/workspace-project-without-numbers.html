<h1><span lang="EN-US">&bdquo;No Number&ldquo; challenge &ndash; vision and reality</span></h1>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The improvements in Adobe Analytics and especially in Analytics Workspace have been great during the past month. While taking the first steps in Workspace projects it has been common that it was just a mix up of different tables. So basically it was just the same as you can see in the normal reports, but all together on one (or more) screens.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">By the time more and more features where implemented which allowed to do custom visualization and custom calculation. The improvements with calculated metrics, segments and date ranges have been a great help both for analysts and for marketers.</span></p>
