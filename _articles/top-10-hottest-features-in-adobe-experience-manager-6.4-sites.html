<p>Adobe Experience Manager 6.4 had its GA release a week after Summit, much sooner than it ever has. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s like they are getting better at it. :) As in years past, I had the chance to attend &ldquo;Adobe Experience Manager Sites: Top 10 New Innovations&rdquo; that was presented by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedrichuesler/">Cedric Huesler</a>, Director Product Management AEM Sites, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathiassiegel/">Mathias Siegel</a>, Senior Product Manager AEM Sites Team. &nbsp;Below is their Top 10 list of new features, with some added commentary from me. If you have been part of the beta program then you might already be familiar with some of these. Let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Experience Fragments Building Blocks</strong> - Experience Fragments are one of the most important features driving fluid experiences in the digital content world. &nbsp;As a reminder, they are different from Content Fragments. Here is a <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kt/platform-repository/using/content-fragments-experience-fragments-article-understand.html">good breakdown of their differences</a>, from Adobe. Now with Experience Fragments you can create variations and versions for use in different channels, reinforcing the idea of content reuse. &nbsp;Their name for this is called Building Blocks. The idea is that you have your Experience Fragment, you convert it into building blocks and then you can create a bunch of variations of Experience Fragments using those building blocks. Thus allowing you to create as many variations of the Experience Fragment as you need. &nbsp;They are linked together so when you make a change to one you will see that flow down to all the others. I&rsquo;m curious if you can disinherit them from each other. Something worth checking.</p>
