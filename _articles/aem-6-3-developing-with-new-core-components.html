<p>In the last couple of years developing components for AEM has become more accesible. We got HTL (formerly Sightly) and Sling models, and TouchUI became more mature and stable. Still, when it was time to get your hands dirty it was difficult to find good examples of how things should be implemented. Geometrixx (and their spin-offs like outdoors or media) had been for very long time the standard reference of how components should be implemented.</p>
