<p>Hi everyone! I&rsquo;m currently working on a very fun task related to a project I&rsquo;m assigned to and thought it&rsquo;s a good one to share.</p>
<p>The client wants to have AMP pages, so they decided to create a PoC with a possible implementation. Interestingly, when I started reading about AMP I found two facts that were really shocking to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slow loading sites frustrate users and negatively impact publishers: 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages take longer than 3 seconds to load!</li>
<li>77% of mobile sites take longer than 10 seconds to load on 3G networks, making it a whole lot of abandoned websites.</li>
</ul>
