<p><a href="https://cqdump.wordpress.com/2017/11/06/information-architecture-content-architecture/">In the last post</a>&nbsp;I tried to describe the difference between the information architecture and content architecture; and from an architectural point of the view the content architecture is quite important, because based on that your application design will emerge. But how can you get to a stable and well-thought content structure?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s no bullet-proof approach for it. When you design the content architecture for an AEM-based application it&rsquo;s best to have some experience with the hierarchical approach offered by the repository approach. I will try to outline a process which might help you to get you there.<br />It&rsquo;s not a definite guideline and I will never guarantee that it will work for you, as it is just based on my experience with the projects I did. But I hope that it will give some input and can act as a kind of checklist for you.
