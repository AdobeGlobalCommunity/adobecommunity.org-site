<p>Adobe Systems Inc. is applying&nbsp;artificial intelligence to new areas, for example&nbsp;<a class="external external_icon" href="https://theblog.adobe.com/photoshop-releases-version-19-1-selections-improvements-advanced-support-windows-high-density-monitors/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">recently</a>&nbsp;infusing machine learning into Photoshop to save time for designers. Today, it&rsquo;s bringing similar automation features to Experience Manager, its marketing content platform for enterprises, in an effort to help companies more easily create and target marketing content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s becoming a creator,&rdquo; Elliot Sedegah, Adobe&rsquo;s group manager of strategy and product marketing for Experience Manager, said in an interview. &ldquo;There are intelligent things you can do along the way without having to think about what&rsquo;s underneath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Headlining the seven update is a capability called Smart Layout. According to Adobe, the tool uses AI to analyze the graphical assets in a company&rsquo;s Experience Manager deployment and recommend what items should be added to a web page for members of a given target audience. Moreover, it generates advice for how to organize the items in a way that increases engagement.</p>
