<p>There is so much documentation out there for Adobe Analytics and GDPR, it&rsquo;s hard to see how it all fits together (though I do feel like <a href="https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/gdpr/an_gdpr_workflow.html" target="_blank">Adobe&rsquo;s documentation on the GDPR workflow</a> is a good place to start). <strong>Note, I am NOT claiming to be an expert on this- I&rsquo;ll defer to Adobe staff for their expertise. And I am NOT offering advice on what/how to regulate- I&rsquo;ll defer to your legal/privacy team for that.</strong>&nbsp;But since I just had to muddle through all this, and learned a lot in the process, I figured I&rsquo;d share my learnings and hopefully help others who are also muddling through.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that in general, when folks are talking about changes in Adobe Analytics to account for GDPR, they&rsquo;re talking about one of three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Obfuscating/removing User IP addresses</li>
<li>Adobe Data Retention Settings</li>
<li>Client Opt-out</li>
</ol>
