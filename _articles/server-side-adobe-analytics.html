<p>Today I will explain how to implement server-side Adobe Analytics. If you have been reading my last few posts, this is a continuation of the series on <a href="https://www.pedromonjo.com/2018/05/server-side-digital-marketing/">server-side digital marketing</a>. I assume you are familiar with <a href="https://www.pedromonjo.com/category/analytics-tips/">Adobe Analytics</a> implementations using JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Capturing data</h2>
<p>When implementing server-side Adobe Analytics, you must perform the same actions you would do with the AppMeasurement JavaScript library in the browser. This library does a lot of the heavy lifting for you, so many data points are captured automatically. However, when going server-side, you need to add all the code necessary to capture the same data points, before forwarding them to Adobe Analytics servers.</p>
