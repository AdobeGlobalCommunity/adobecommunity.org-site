<p>In November, I posted about some of the ways that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitaldatatactics.com/index.php/2017/11/20/adobe-dtm-launch-improvements-for-single-page-apps/">Launch will make it easier to implement on Single Page Apps (SPAs)</a>, but I hinted that a few things were still lacking.<br />In mid-January, the&nbsp;<a href="https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/experience-cloud/launch/release-notes.html">Launch team announced</a>&nbsp;a feature I&rsquo;ve been eagerly awaiting: the ability to order your rules.
