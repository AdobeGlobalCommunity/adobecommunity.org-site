<p>According to a 2017&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mprofs/2017-b2c-content-marketing-benchmarks-budgets-and-trends" target="_blank">study</a>&nbsp;conducted by MarketingProfs and the Content Marketing Institute, 23% of B2C marketers said their overall content marketing success was flat year-over-year. But why? The top two reasons cited are strategy issues (49%) and not enough time devoted to content marketing (48%).</p>
<p>Data from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic" target="_blank">DemandMetric</a>&nbsp;even shows content marketing costs 62% less than traditional marketing and generates about three times as many conversions. With the rise of content marketing, automation and technology to reduce waste and increase yield would suggest that practitioners today are actually doing content right. But the numbers are elusive.</p>
