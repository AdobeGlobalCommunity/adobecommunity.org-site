<p>Adobe Summit kicked off with a bang with the General Session this morning! Shantanu Narayen and Brad Rencher elaborated Adobe&rsquo;s vision for building an ecosystem for Experience Makers. Adobe&rsquo;s vision for the Experience System of Record is a tremendous goal for every experience-driven organization to strive to achieve.</p>
<p>The combination of Content and Data is a theme Adobe had discussed last year at Summit, but they are refining the vision and bringing more practical tools and insights to enable customers to deliver on the promise.&nbsp;</p>
