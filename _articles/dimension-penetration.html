<p><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />Last week, I&nbsp;<a href="https://analyticsdemystified.com/adobe-analytics/approximate-count-distinct-function-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained how the Approximate Count Distinct function in Adobe Analytics</a>&nbsp;can be used to see how many distinct dimension values occur within a specified timeframe. In that post, I showed how you could see how many different products or campaign codes are viewed without having to count up rows manually and how the function provided by Adobe can then be used in other Calculated Metrics. As a follow-on to that post, in this post, I am going to share a concept that I call &ldquo;dimension penetration %.&rdquo; The idea of dimension penetration % is that there may be times in which you want to see&nbsp;<em>what % of all possible dimension values</em>&nbsp;are viewed or have some other action taken. For example, you may want to see what % of all products available on your website were added to the shopping cart this month. The goal here is to identify the maximum number of dimension values (for a time period) and compare that to the number of dimension values that were acted upon (in the same time period). Here are just some of the business questions that you might want to answer with the concept of dimension penetration %:</p>
<ul>
<li>What % of available products are being viewed, added to cart, etc&hellip;?</li>
<li>What % of available documents are being downloaded?</li>
<li>What % of BOPIS products are picked up in store?</li>
<li>What % of all campaign codes are being clicked?</li>
<li>What % of all content items are viewed?</li>
<li>What % of available videos are viewed?</li>
<li>What % of all blog posts are viewed?</li>
</ul>
