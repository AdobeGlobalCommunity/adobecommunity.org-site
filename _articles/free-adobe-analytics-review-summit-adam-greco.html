<p>For the past seven years (and many years prior to that while at Omniture!), I have&nbsp;<a href="http://analyticsdemystified.com/services/adobe-analytics-implementation/adobe-analytics-audit/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reviewed/audited</a>&nbsp;hundreds of Adobe Analytics implementations. In most cases, I find mistakes that have been made and things that organizations are not doing that they should be. Both of these issues impede the ability of organizations to be successful with Adobe Analytics. Poorly implemented items can lead to bad analysis and missed implementation items represent an opportunity cost for data analysis that could be done, but isn't. Unfortunately, most organizations "don't know what they don't know" about implementing Adobe Analytics, because the people working there have only implemented Adobe Analytics oncee, or possibly two times, versus people like me who do it for a living. In reality, I see a lot of the same common mistakes over and over again and I have found that showing my clients what is incorrect and what can be done instead is a great way for them to learn how to master Adobe Analytics (something I do in my popular&nbsp;<a href="http://analyticsdemystified.com/adobe-analytics-top-gun-training/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Adobe Analytics "Top Gun" Class</a>).</p>
