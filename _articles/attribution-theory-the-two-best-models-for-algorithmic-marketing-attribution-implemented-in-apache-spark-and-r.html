<p><a href="http://datafeedtoolbox.com/multi-touch-attribution-using-adobe-analytics-data-feeds-and-r/">In my last post</a>, I illustrated methods for implementing rules-based multi-touch attribution models (such as first touch, last touch, linear, half-life time decay, and U-shaped) using Adobe Analytics Data Feeds, Apache Spark, and R. These models are indeed useful and appealing for analyzing the contribution any marketing channel has to overall conversions.&nbsp;However, they all share a common problem: they&rsquo;re heuristic &ndash; meaning at the end of the day, a human being&nbsp;is still left guessing at marketing performance without any real data to back those guesses.</p>
