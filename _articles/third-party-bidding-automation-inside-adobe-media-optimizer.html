<p>Bidding automation in paid search is a hot topic and a growing area of opportunity for profit-minded advertisers. As the scope of digital marketing programs continues to increase, sophisticated bidding tools can provide greater scale and precision to reach optimal return targets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that AdWords has been emphasizing its own Smart Bidding tools. But, as a paid search specialist, I have found that these offer very little flexibility, especially for advertisers that have specific or complex business needs. To bridge the gap, various third-party bidding automation tools offer features designed to adapt to these unique challenges.</p>
<p>At&nbsp;<a href="https://www.perficientdigital.com/">Perficient Digital</a>, we use Adobe Media Optimizer (soon to be rebranded to Adobe Advertising Cloud Search) for enterprise-level clients. Adobe Media Optimizer (AMO) is a tool that automates and optimizes bids across search campaigns using robust conversion and cost models to determine optimal bids and yield the highest possible return on ad spend.</p>
