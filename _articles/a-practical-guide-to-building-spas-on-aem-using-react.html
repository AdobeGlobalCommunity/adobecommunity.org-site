<p>When I talked about modern front-end productivity on AEM&nbsp;<a href="http://experiencemanaged.com/posts/building-a-simple-and-scaleable-ultra-modern-front-end-build-system-for-aem.html">last year</a>, I lamented how there wasn't a good solution for Javascript templating (really, Single Page Applications).</p>
<blockquote>Templating... templating is a challenging one that I don't think has been solved sufficiently. Handlebars is a natural fit, but it misses the mark in certain contexts. If I'm doing a new AEM project today, I'm using HBS, but I'm yearning for something better.</blockquote>
