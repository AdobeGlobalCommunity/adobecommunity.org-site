<p>In my previous post, <a href="https://blogs.perficient.com/adobe/2017/12/07/mastering-aem-dispatcher-part-5-managing-redirects-like-a-master/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" shape="rect">Mastering AEM Dispatcher Part 5: Managing Redirects Like a Master</a>, I introduced an easy way to maintain lists of redirects in AEM. After using the tool for awhile, the team suggested some improvements to make it easier to maintain redirect maps, especially when maintaining an existing list of redirects.</p>
<p>Most users found the process of downloading the file, making updates and re-uploading confusing as it was easy to accidentally upload the wrong file to the wrong configuration.</p>
<p>To make it easier to add, update and remove individual entries, I added a new editor to allow users to create, find and remove entries from the redirect list. The latest version <a href="https://github.com/Adobe-Consulting-Services/acs-aem-commons/releases/tag/acs-aem-commons-3.17.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener" shape="rect">ACS AEM Commons, version 3.17.0</a>, includes an new Edit Entries tab which makes it easy for administrators and advanced users to modify the redirect map without having to deal with uploading and downloading redirect map files.</p>
