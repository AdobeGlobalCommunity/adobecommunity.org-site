<p>The Apache Sling project recently announced the latest version of our runnable distribution, Apache Sling 10 or Apache Sling X if you are a fruit company fan. And much like the latest fruit product release, this release of Apache Sling is 32% skinnier and costs 200% more, after all, it&rsquo;s still free!</p>
