<p><a href="https://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/target/search-and-promote.html">Adobe Search&amp;Promote</a>&nbsp;is a powerful SaaS search offering within the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud.html">Adobe Marketing Cloud</a>. By integrating Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) and Adobe Search&amp;Promote, you can create extremely powerful search-driven experiences in AEM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may ask, why do you need a 3rd party search service when AEM includes a Search component?&nbsp;This feature searches directly in the CMS using native Lucene searching to search the content in AEM&rsquo;s repository. It is useful for small sites or basic needs, but is limited to only the contents of the AEM repository and does not support facets so more robust&nbsp;experiences will need a third party search tool.</p>
