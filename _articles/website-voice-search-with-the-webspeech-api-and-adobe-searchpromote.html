<p>With the takeover of the web by mobile browsers, tailoring experiences to mobile users is critical to creating successful experiences.&nbsp;Nearly 21.6% of mobile visitors using voice search on a daily basis, so providing voice search on mobile web experiences helps to&nbsp;create a more native experience for mobile users. Historically there has not been a good API for integrating voice recognition into websites, however, the (relatively) new&nbsp;WebSpeech API makes this possible right through JavaScript. This API is still experimental&nbsp;and only works in&nbsp;certain browsers, but has significant promise to more closely align web and native mobile experiences.&nbsp;</p>
