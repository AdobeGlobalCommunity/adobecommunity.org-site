<p>Adobe is out this week with its next-generation tag management platform.</p>
<p>Called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adobe.com/enterprise/cloud-platform/launch.html">Launch</a>&nbsp;and built into the Adobe Cloud Platform, it is based on technology acquired when the tech giant&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/31/adobe-makes-deeper-move-into-marketing-and-ad-tech-buys-satellite-for-tag-management-technology/">bought</a>&nbsp;a tag management technology called Satellite in 2013. Launch was announced as a beta release at Adobe Summit in March, and it&rsquo;s now out in general release.</p>
<p>Adobe Product Marketing Manager Jon Viray told me that the previous Adobe tag management offering, called Dynamic Tag Management or DTM, is primarily designed for providing page tags for Adobe&rsquo;s tools. Users could integrate third-party marketing tools into DTM by adding the necessary JavaScript, he said, but they couldn&rsquo;t easily add much functionality.</p>
