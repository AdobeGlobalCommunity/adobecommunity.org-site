<p>When I am working on a project to <a href="https://analyticsdemystified.com/services/adobe-analytics-implementation/adobe-analytics-audit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">audit someone&rsquo;s Adobe Analytics implementation</a>, one of the things I often notice is a lack of organization that surrounds the implementation. When you use Adobe Analytics, there are a lot of &ldquo;components&rdquo; that you can customize for your implementation. These components include Segments, Calculated Metrics, Reports, Dashboards, etc. I have some clients that have hundreds of Segments or Calculated Metrics, to the point that finding the one you are looking for can be like searching for a needle in a haystack! Over time, it is so easy to keep creating more and more Adobe Analytics components instead of re-using the ones that already exist. When new, duplicative components are created, things can get very chaotic because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different users could use different components in reports/dashboards</li>
<li>Changes made to fix a component may only be fixed in some places if there are duplicative components floating out there</li>
<li>Multiple components with the same name or definition can confuse novice users</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, I am a big fan of keeping your Adobe Analytics components under control, which takes some work, but pays dividends in the long run.&nbsp; A few years ago, I <a href="https://analyticsdemystified.com/technicalimplementation/corporate-logins-labels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote a post about how you can use a &ldquo;Corporate Login&rdquo; to help manage key Adobe Analytics components</a>. I still endorse that concept, but today, I will share another technique I have started using to organize components in case you find it helpful.</p>
