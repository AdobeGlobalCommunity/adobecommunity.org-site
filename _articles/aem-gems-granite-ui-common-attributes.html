<p>In Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), Granite UI is the foundation UI framework to build touch-enabled UI consoles and component dialogs. It provides a set of&nbsp;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/granite-ui/api/jcr_root/libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/server.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out-of-the-box (OOTB) components</a>&nbsp;that you can use to build consoles or component dialogs. In this blog, I want to talk about a small tech gem that a lot of AEM developers are not aware of,&nbsp;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/granite-ui/api/jcr_root/libs/granite/ui/docs/server/commonattrs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Granite UI common attributes</a>. In fact, I firstly encountered them in the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-core-wcm-components" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AEM WCM core components</a>, then when I was reading the&nbsp;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/granite-ui/api/jcr_root/libs/granite/ui/components/legacy/coral2/migration.html#streamlining-the-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Granite UI migration guide</a>&nbsp;for the dialog conversion from Coral UI 2 to Coral UI 3 (AEM 6.2 to 6.3), I saw that this is listed to streamline the API and replace existing properties.</p>
<p>Note: this was tested on AEM 6.3. All the source code used in this blog can be found in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/guangweiyao/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my GitHub project</a>.</p>
