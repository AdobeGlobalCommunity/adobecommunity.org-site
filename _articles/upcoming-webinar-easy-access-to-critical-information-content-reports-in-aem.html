<h3>&nbsp;IT&rsquo;S ALMOST TIME!</h3>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>In just under a week, on April 24th, I will be presenting at the next Ask the Community Expert session about AEM Content Reports. I previously covered AEM Content Reports in my post&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.perficient.com/adobe/2018/01/25/new-perficient-digital-content-reports-aem/">New From Perficient Digital: Content Reports in AEM</a>.</p>
<p>This webinar will go deeper and show you how to use this powerful new feature in ACS AEM Commons. The webinar will include a virtual walkthrough and demo of using, configuring and customizing AEM Content Reports.</p>
