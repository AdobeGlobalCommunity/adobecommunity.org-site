<p>A while ago I wrote about the Adobe Analytics&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pedromonjo.com/2017/05/clickstream-data-feed/">data feed</a>. Adobe Audience Manager has the same concept: you can get a file with the raw data. This feed is call Customer Data Feed or CDF.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why would you want the Customer Data Feed</h2>
<p>Before going to the details, you need to question yourself why you want it. It does not make sense to just get it because you want to hoard as much data as you can. With GDPR in the horizon, you should only have the minimal amount of data needed to run your business.</p>
<p>Besides, the CDF generates huge amounts of data. I was talking a few days ago with one of my colleagues and I asked him which customers he knew were using CDF. He said that many customers request it, but when we explain them the amount of data it will generate, most of them realise it is not worth it.</p>
