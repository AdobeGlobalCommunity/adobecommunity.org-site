<h1 id="top-features-of-aem-assets-6-4">Top Features of AEM Assets 6.4</h1>
<p>In Summits past, I have always let Peter attend all the &ldquo;Top Features&rdquo; sessions, because as a Systems Engineer (and management to boot) I wasn&rsquo;t that interested in the &ldquo;features&rdquo; of AEM except for how the impacted me on the Operational side of things. However, now that I have made the jump over to the customer side, I took the opportunity this year to go to the &ldquo;AEM Assets&rdquo; Top 10 session hosted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuasramirez/">Josh Ramirez</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/esedegah/">Elliot Sedegah</a>.</p>
<p>Having just attended the &ldquo;Top 10 Features of AEM Sites&rdquo; earlier in the day, I was really surprised at the difference in tone and presentational style. Rather than a laundry list of features, we were treated to a much more dynamic visual and auditory presentation. Some of the announcements were really exciting and addressed very real pain points my AEM Assets end-users suffer under daily, while others seemed a bit too &ldquo;high-concept&rdquo; or conceptual for me.</p>
