<p>As you know, support for Adobe&rsquo;s Dynamic Tag Manager (DTM) is going away. That doesn&rsquo;t mean the platform will be shut down anytime soon, but it&nbsp;<em>does</em> mean you should consider migrating your implementation to Adobe Launch in the near future. One question you&rsquo;ll want answered before migrating is: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference between Adobe Launch vs. DTM?&rdquo; The short answer: A lot&hellip; and at the same time not much.</p>
