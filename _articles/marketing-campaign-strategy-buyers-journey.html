<h1>Mapping a Buyer&rsquo;s Journey and Building your Campaign Strategy</h1>
<p>In today&rsquo;s marketing environment, identifying customers that have a need for your product or service and have the potential to move through the sales process to become an actual customer can be easier said than done. Marketing automation leveraging data-driven insights certainly helps but in our experience, the biggest component of a successful campaign strategy hinges on sales and marketing alignment, a clear understanding of where the data lies (and in what systems), and a firm understanding of how a customer flows through the sales cycle.</p>
<p>What characteristics do customers have during each phase of the process? What are their questions? and what messaging is relevant to them at that time? These are all questions that need to be asked in this planning phase. There is no denying that tight marketing and sales alignment, an understanding of your organizations unique buyer&rsquo;s funnel (and documentation) will help your organization create a campaign strategy that will effectively reach your customers with best message and offer, at the right time.</p>
