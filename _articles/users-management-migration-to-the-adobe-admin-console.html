<p>It is on July the 12th, that Adobe Analytics users will be able to use the Adobe Admin console to manage platform users as well as the authorizations. The primary goal is to migrate existing Adobe Analytics users to Adobe Experience Cloud in stages.</p>
<p>So if you are a system administrator, the Admin Console will provide you a single interface to manage all the users in your organization, no matter what Adobe products they use. You can also add new users to the Admin console using their Adobe ID or corporate credentials.</p>
