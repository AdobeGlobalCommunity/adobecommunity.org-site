<p>Let's get together to discuss best practices around AEM Communities and how it can be leveraged to engage customers. We will also host a couple additional non-communities talks so let us know if you are interested in sharing with the SF AEM Meetup.<br /><br />The goal of SF-AEM is to give the community a forum to exchange ideas and interact in an informal atmosphere. The group is open to all AEM users regardless of level or background and we are hoping to touch on a variety of topics relevant to authors, developers and businesses.</p>
