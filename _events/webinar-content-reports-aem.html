<p>As a content manager, you need data to manage the content development and maintenance process. This includes using Analytics to understand content effectiveness, identify stale content, measure productivity of content writers, and manage content translations. Perficient Digital contributed a new feature, Report Builder, to ACS AEM Commons. Learn how Report Builder allows Adobe Experience Manager administrators to create and execute reports on the content in Experience Manager, and how it helps content managers and administrators get their data with flexible, configurable reports.</p>
