<p>We are all great at creating content...but what about taking it down? It may seem as easy as &ldquo;flipping a switch&rdquo;, but there can be unseen ramifications to deleting content from a large, global, enterprise site. Come learn how Intel manages the final phase of the content development lifecycle and gain a deeper understanding of how End-of-Life (EOL) processes can protect your brand, keep your message on-point and potentially reduce legal risk.</p>

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>Scott Strohmeyer is a System Analyst who has worked on intel.com in one capacity or another since joining Intel in 2000. His journey with EOL started in response to continued issues related to the site in 2005, where he conceived of and developed a process to determine and remove orphan files from the site. This eventually evolved into the EOL process used today. Since then he has worked on evolving the process, the tools and documentation over the past 11 years not only in response to changes in hosting platforms, environmental changes but also to increase efficiency and reduce cost. Additionally, he has managed transitions between multiple teams charged with doing the work including teams in US, Costa Rica and now India. He has a Bachelors in Economics and a Masters in Information Technology. Is married with 5 children and 6 grandchildren and coaches the Pole Vault at a local area high school.</p>
